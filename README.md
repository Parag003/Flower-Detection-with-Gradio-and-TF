# Flower Detection with TensorFlow and Gradio

## Overview

This project is a machine learning application built using TensorFlow for flower detection. The goal is to identify different types of flowers from images using a pre-trained deep learning model. The user interface is powered by Gradio, providing an easy and interactive way to test and deploy the model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/flower-detection.git
cd flower-detection
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the Gradio app:

```bash
python app.py
```

2. Open your web browser and go to [http://localhost:7860](http://localhost:7860) to interact with the flower detection interface.

3. Upload an image of a flower, and the model will predict its type.

## Model

The flower detection model is built using TensorFlow and is based on a pre-trained deep learning architecture. The model has been fine-tuned on a dataset of various flower types to achieve accurate predictions.

## Gradio Interface

Gradio provides an intuitive and customizable web interface for testing and deploying machine learning models. In this project, it allows users to upload images, visualize predictions, and experience the flower detection model in real-time.
